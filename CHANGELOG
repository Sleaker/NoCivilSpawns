1.3.2
Added simple configuration option for only cancelling monster spawns.

1.3.1
Added configuration options for specific mob types.
You can now whitelist or blacklist any mob, this will cause them to either not spawn at all, or always spawn regardless of location.

1.3.0
Added Configuration file for turning on/off a couple user defined options.
Quicktesting is enabled by default.  This will check a 1 block radius under the spawn for cobble, woodplank, glass and immediately cancel if any blocks are found.
Diamond Blocks can be set to function like spawner blocks.  If one is found during the spawnblock check the plugin will allow the spawn. Useful for mob traps.
Gold Blocks can be set to immediately cancel the spawn when found during the last detection phase.  If one is found at all, the event is canceled.  Useful for denying spawns in 'natural areas'
